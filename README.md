# Redis Project

This project demonstrates how to use Redis for storing and retrieving data efficiently.

## Project Overview

Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used for caching, session management, and various other tasks. This project showcases how Redis can be used to store key-value pairs and retrieve them using Python and C#.

## Technologies Used

- **Redis**: A fast, in-memory database for key-value storage.
- **Python**: Backend code to interact with Redis for setting and retrieving data.

## How the Project Works

In this project, we interact with a Redis database by performing basic operations such as:

1. **Connecting to Redis**: Establishing a connection to the Redis server with authentication details.
2. **Setting Data**: Storing key-value pairs in Redis for future retrieval.
3. **Getting Data**: Fetching the stored data using the key.

## Setup Instructions

### For Python

To use Redis with Python, you'll need the `redis` package. Install it with pip:

```
pip install redis
```

Once installed, you can write Python code to connect to Redis, store data, and retrieve it.

### For C#

For C# implementation, install the `StackExchange.Redis` package via NuGet:

```
Install-Package StackExchange.Redis
```

After installation, you can use StackExchange.Redis to connect and interact with Redis in C#.

## How to Run the Project

Ensure you have a running Redis instance with the correct credentials. Replace the placeholder values for the Redis host, port, and password with your actual Redis connection details.

You can run the Python or C# scripts provided to interact with Redis and see the data being stored and retrieved.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a simple introduction to using Redis for key-value data storage. Redis is known for its speed and efficiency, making it an ideal solution for scenarios where fast data retrieval is required.
